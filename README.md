# Conways-Game-Of-Life

A basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. It doesn't need any 3rd part libraries. 

Tested working on a Fedora default terminal with Python 3.9 but it should work on most linux terminals.

It will "fill" the terminal window.

Starting seed is random. Use "q" key to exit.


```
python conwaysGameOfLife.py
```

to run the code.
